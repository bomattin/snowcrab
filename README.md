# Snowcrab - Intuitive Web Browser for your terminal_size

*Yet another overly ambitious Rust project. ;)*

### What?

A command-driven, intuitive web browser written in Rust designed with ease of use in mind.

### Why?

* Command lines are cool.
* Command Palettes (such as those in VS Code or Atom) are SUPER COOL and could benefit a lot of somewhat archaic command line applications (Think tmux, vim)
* Typing is fast, clicking is slow.
* Many command line applications suck at UX. They don't have to.
* Rust is awesome

### How?

Leverage several high-quality Rust crates, including, but not limited to:

* termion
* HTTP5ever
* CLAP

### When?

This project was launched on March 1, 2017. My goal is to have a beta release
before March 1, 2018. No other timeline or roadmap is offered at this time.

### Planned Features

* Display clean, uncluttered text web pages while remaining faithful to graphical browser presentation
* Safely maintain cookies and other session data
* Allow form field input
* Command palette exposing every bit of functionality in the application. Just type what you want to do, and go!
* Extensible and customizable with user config files and site-specific format files
* Ease of access for common reference websites (Google, Stackoverflow, Quora, Wikipedia, etc.)

*This software is distributed under the GPL-3 license*
